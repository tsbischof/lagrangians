<h1>Lagrangians: A package for visualising nonlinear behaviour in ordinary differential equations</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In classical dynamics, it is only infrequently possible to obtain exact analytical solutions for the equations of motion for a given system. Fortunately, methods have been developed to simulate solutions to these systems of differential equations, with various degrees of accuracy and efficiency. However, watching invidual trajectories evolve can be a bit boring or uninformative, so we want to spice things up by presenting nice graphs of the data with the important bits highlighted.</p>
<p>One method for such visualization is to study the effect of small changes in the initial conditions of a system. For pure linear systems (those without coupling between bodies), these changes are typically reasonably gradual, and in someof the most simple cases can be solved exactly analytically. One such case is the motion of a particle in a harmonic potential well, which is realized as a mass on a spring, to a first-order approximation. For such motion, we can make analytic predictions about these results, and therefore do not require more advanced techniques. These analytic solutions remain of interest as checks of the accuracy of our more complicated systems.</p>
<p>One classic example of a non-linear system is the double pendulum. In this system, we imagine a massless stick attached to a hinge on a fixed ceiling, with a mass attached to the bottom. To this mass is attached a second pendulum with a second mass. Because the position of the lower mass depends simultaneously on the angle of the lower and upper arms, there is a coupling (non-linear) term which appears in the velocity expression for this mass (see the <a href="lagrangians.pdf">paper</a> for a further discussion). As a general rule, non-linear systems are not solvable by analytic methods and are extremely sensitive to their initial conditions, and so we have to resort to using reasonable numerical integrators to study the evolution of these systems.</p>
