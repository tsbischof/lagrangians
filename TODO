-do proper checks of return statuses (error checking? How silly)
-be more careful with the Points object, and pass copies when it makes sense.
-simplify the grapher, such that we can do parallel runs more easily.
-put the new version online, and update the paper
-make a configuration file which lets us set things like the location of ImageMagick
-modify the gui to use the new system
